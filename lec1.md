# What is AI #
There are four approaches for defining AI:
---
1. **Acting Humanly**
    > *The “Turing” Test*

      `The test consists of three components:`
      1. The computer
      2. A person
      3. An evaluator

      *If the evaluator cannot tell the difference between the person and the computer, then the computer passes the intelligent test*

      `The computer would need the following capabilities:`
      1. Natural language processing
      1. Knowledge representation
      1. Automated reasoning
      1. Machine learning
    ---
2. **Thinking Humanly**
    > *If we are going to say that a given program thinks like a human, we must have some way of determining how humans think.*
    
      `There are three ways to do this:`
      1. By trying to catch our own thoughts
      2. Through psychological experiments
      3. Through brain imaging
    ---
3. **Thinking Rationally**
    >***`“Aristotle” `** said: the correct conclusion is always obtained when giving correct premises.*
    ---
4. **Acting Rationally**
    > *A **`rational agent `** is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome.*
